# Uptime
 A Small, Reliable, Efficient, Cross-Platform Uptime Monitoring Service with Batteries Included


#Ideas

Endpoints:
/api/v1/hosts: A GET endpoint to retrieve a list of all hosts being tracked, including their current status (up or down), last check-in time, and other relevant metadata.
/api/v1/hosts/{id}: A GET endpoint to retrieve information about a specific host, including its status, last check-in time, and other metadata.
/api/v1/hosts/{id}/status: A POST endpoint to update the status of a specific host.
/api/v1/hosts/{id}/checks: A GET endpoint to retrieve a list of recent check-in times for a specific host.
/api/v1/reports/daily: A GET endpoint to generate a report of uptime statistics for all hosts in the past 24 hours.
/api/v1/reports/weekly: A GET endpoint to generate a report of uptime statistics for all hosts in the past 7 days.
/api/v1/reports/monthly: A GET endpoint to generate a report of uptime statistics for all hosts in the past 30 days.
Components:
A scheduler to periodically check the status of each host and update the database with the results.
A database to store information about each host, including its name, IP address, and other relevant metadata.
A reporting engine to generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports of uptime statistics.
A REST client or library to interact with the hosts being monitored, such as using the ICMP protocol to send ping requests and receive responses.
A logging and monitoring system to keep track of errors and other relevant events.
